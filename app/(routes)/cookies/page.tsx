				This Cookie Policy explains how DMV.gg (&quot;Company&quot;,
				&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, and &quot;our&quot;) uses cookies and
				similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at
				https://dmv.gg (&quot;Website&quot;). It explains what these

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What are cookies?</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
				device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
				owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
				efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
			</p>
			<p className="mb-4">
				Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, DMV.gg) are called
				&quot;first-party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by parties other than the
				website owner are called &quot;third-party cookies&quot;. Third-party
				cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on
				or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
				analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize
				your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
				it visits certain other websites.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
				cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
				operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
				&quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
				track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
				our Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
				advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Types of cookies we use</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our
				Website and the purposes they perform are described below:
			</p>

			<h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Essential cookies:</h3>
			<p className="mb-4">
				These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
				available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as
				access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to
				deliver the Website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our
				Website functions.
			</p>

			<h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">
				Performance and Functionality cookies:
			</h3>
			<p className="mb-4">
				These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
				our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these
				cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
			</p>

			<h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">
				Analytics and Customization cookies:
			</h3>
			<p className="mb-4">
				These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form
				to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our
				marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you in
				order to enhance your experience.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
				How can you control cookies?
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
				can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate
				opt-out links provided below.
			</p>
			<p className="mb-4">
				You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
				cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website
				though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be
				restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your
				web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
				browser&apos;s help menu for more information.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Do not track signals</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				Some browsers have incorporated &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) features
				that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not
				wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of
				how to interpret the DNT signal, our Website does not currently respond
				to browser DNT signals.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
				Changes to this Cookie Policy
			</h2>
			<p className="mb-4">
				We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
				for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational,
				legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie
				Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
				technologies.
			</p>
			<p className="mb-4">
				The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last
				updated.
